# Login-SignUp
This is a BridgeLabz Assignment that involves creating Login and Sign Up pages using React.js and React DOM. In UC2, I implemented validation logic for form inputs. In UC3, I integrated API calls to send requests from the frontend to the server for user authentication and registration processes.
